- Simulate common cloud security issues
- Evaluate alert clarity and usefulness for resource-limited teams

## Repository Structure
- `terraform/` – Terraform configuration for provisioning the AWS test environment
- Documentation and analysis artifacts will be added in later milestones

## Status
- Milestone 1: Minimal AWS environment provisioned using Terraform (completed)
